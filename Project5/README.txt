GetLength() returns the length, getWidth() returns the width, getPerimeter() returns the perimeter and a compareTo method which compares two rectangles on the basis of their perimeter. Followed instructions completely to create this. Compile using Terminal: javac Rectangle.javaRun using Terminal: java RectangleProblem1.java: for Problem1.java, I created a program that finds the largest rectangle on the basis of the perimeter. I hardcoded an array of rectangles, inputting varied lengths and widths for each. The program returns the perimeter of the largest rectangle as well as the length and width of this rectangle. I did not alter the FindMax method in any way and followed the instructions completely.Compile using Terminal: javac Problem1.javaRun using Terminal: java Problem1Problem2.java: for Problem2.java, I created a program that will find a Rectangle in an array of rectangles. I had to implement a helper method, binarySearch2, that was necessary so that the begin and end variables could be kept track of as they were being changed. I then called this helper method in the binarySearch method that was given to us. Nothing about this method given to us was changed in my program. I then hardcoded an array of Rectangles using varied widths and lengths. When the program compiles, it returns the index of the found rectangle in the sorted array.Compile using Terminal: javac Problem2.javaRun using Terminal: java Problem2Problem3.java: For Problem3.java, I created a method for each snippet of code that was provided to us. I then called these methods in between each time measurement code line and created a variable, “difference”, that would provide the elapsed time for each run. I used System.nanoTime() for measurements in nanoseconds to ensure accuracy. I changed the Foo method to static in order to run this, and changed the return type and the parameters to type long instead of int to prevent errors for large inputs or large results.Compile using Terminal: javac Problem3.javaRun using Terminal: java Problem3
